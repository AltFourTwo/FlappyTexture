# FlappyTexture
First LibGDX "game", for Android.

I was just experimenting with LibGDX and following tutorials on youtube.  
I ended up with this. I learned a few things but they're not worth mentioning, except I got experience with LibGDX.

You "play" as an animated square (flashing through a placeholder tilemap),  
tap to "flap" up and avoid the "lasers" coming your way.
